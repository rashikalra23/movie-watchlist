# Project Title

The movie watchlist app allows users to create accounts with just an email address, simplifying the process. Users can easily log in and out using their email addresses. They can search for movies by title and view detailed information such as release year, and poster. Additionally, users can create their personalized watchlists and add movies to them, and view them at any time. If multiple users log in or log out, they are be able to see their respective information, as it has been saved.
